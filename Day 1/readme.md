# Topic : Titanic Tutorial

-I completed an assignment in Day 1. The assignment was "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". Here, we need to predict the number of passengers who survived after the events of Titanic from the given dataset. I used "random forest model" algorithm to solve this problem. This is my very first implemented machine learning model.
