# Day 4 of 30 Days of ML by #Kaggle

#Topic : Booleans and Conditionals

In this lesson, you’ll learn all about the Boolean data type, which allows you to represent “True” and “False” in Python code. This will provide a strong foundation for understanding how to write conditional statements, which are used to modify how code runs based on whether certain conditions hold. 

In day 4, I completed an optional problem which is a simplified version of blackjack. The problem was very interesting. I achieved only 42.1% win rate for this problem :)
