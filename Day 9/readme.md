# Day 9 of 30 Days of ML by #Kaggle

# Topic-1 : Your First Machine Learning Model

-In this lesson, you’ll create a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library, one of the most popular and efficient tools for data analysis. 

-Along the way, you’ll learn some basic techniques for working with very large datasets. These skills are especially important for modern data scientists, who often work with “big data” containing millions of variables ― many more than a human can conceivably understand!
